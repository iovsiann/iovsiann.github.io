            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I'm building Remake.ai, a company with a simple but ambitious goal: to make home robots run apps.</p>
<p>Y Combinator (my startup accelerator idol) strongly recommends that startups have cofounders, and I believe that having one could significantly improve my chances of getting accepted. At the same time, I should admit: I don't strictly need a cofounder. I'm technical and hands-on enough to build everything myself. Beyond that, I can hire, contract, or outsource the rest—from business operations to sales.</p>
<p>Still, I decided to give the search an honest try. Here's what I've done so far:</p>
<p><strong>Announced the startup publicly.</strong> I came out of stealth on LinkedIn.</p>
<p><strong>Signed up for YC's cofounder matching platform.</strong> I've connected with a few people there, but progress has been slow. About half of my "matches" are really using the platform to get hired, rather than to cofound.</p>
<p><strong>Reached out to former colleagues.</strong> These are people I consider 10x engineers and would gladly work with again. About half replied, but none were available.</p>
<p><strong>Posted online.</strong> I shared my search on LinkedIn, relevant subreddits, Hacker News and industry forums. Mostly silence. I did post in r/roastmystartup and got a helpful reply—thank you, internet stranger! Posting on Hacker News under the title of "Roast my startup" got me another reply.</p>
<p><strong>Posted a job opening on LinkedIn.</strong> Another experiment, with similar results.</p>
<p><strong>Hired recruiters.</strong></p>
<p>After about a month of this, here's what I've learned:</p>
<p><strong>The potential cofounder pool is small.</strong> YC's platform shows about 16K total, worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>The filtered pool is tiny.</strong> For people in the Bay Area, interested in robotics, and available to quit their jobs soon, that number drops to just a few hundred.</p>
<p><strong>After manually reviewing profiles,</strong> I've identified about a dozen I'd actually like to talk to.</p>
<p><strong>Response rates aren't great:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>~50% of invites are declined.</li>
<li>~20% of accepted invites never lead to a meeting.</li>
<li>Of those I meet, about half are really just looking for a job.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On the bright side,</strong> there's a surprisingly wide range of aspiring cofounders—ages 16 to 70.</p>
<p>All in all, it hasn't felt like much progress.</p>
<p>But—I think I may have found a different solution. One that I genuinely love. It might seem unusual, surprising, or even a little shocking.</p>
<p>I'll share it in my next post.</p>
