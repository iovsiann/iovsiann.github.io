                <h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>I'm excited to launch this blog as a space to share my thoughts and experiences in technology, particularly around deep learning, AI hardware, and imaging systems.</p>
<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>In this blog, you can expect posts covering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deep Learning Hardware</strong>: Insights into neural network accelerator design, optimization techniques, and architectural patterns</li>
<li><strong>AI and Machine Learning</strong>: Practical applications, research trends, and lessons learned from deploying AI systems</li>
<li><strong>Imaging Technology</strong>: CMOS sensors, image processing pipelines, and computational photography</li>
<li><strong>Software Engineering</strong>: Best practices, tools, and techniques I've found valuable over the years</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>With over two decades in technology spanning hardware design, ASIC development, deep learning, and imaging systems, I've had the opportunity to work on projects that shipped in over a billion devices. I've architected neural inference hardware, designed imaging sensors, and led teams tackling complex technical challenges.</p>
<p>This blog is a way to give back to the technical community and share knowledge gained through years of hands-on experience.</p>
<h2>Get in Touch</h2>
<p>I'm always interested in connecting with fellow technologists. Feel free to reach out via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iliao/">LinkedIn</a> or check out my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UMqM9DQAAAAJ">publications</a> to learn more about my work.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and I hope you find the content here valuable!</p>
