                <p><strong>TL;DR for busy professionals:</strong><br />
- Claude codes like a brilliant junior developer — and here's how to compensate for that.<br />
- I've managed to break Claude (and figured out how to fix it).<br />
- My real pain is Claude's presentations and artifacts (and why).<br />
- Sometimes Claude doesn't know something — and that's OK (easy fix).<br />
- I still love Claude — she gives me a 48× productivity multiplier.</p>
<p>In a previous post, I promised to write about the drawbacks of using Claude.ai.</p>
<p>I've been delaying it — because, honestly, I've struggled to find any.</p>
<p>I've been using Claude for about three months, and I meant it when I wrote that Claude has been my de-facto cofounder while I search for a human one.<br />
- Someone to bounce ideas with.<br />
- Erudite. Available 24/7. Eager to help.<br />
- All for $20 per month.</p>
<p>Claude has built the entire MVP prototype for my startup Remake.ai — and I could not be happier with the results.</p>
<p>But, yes — there are drawbacks. Let's get into them.</p>
<h2>👧1. Claude codes like a brilliant, yet junior developer</h2>
<p>Claude's first-pass implementations consistently look like the work of a brilliant but junior dev.</p>
<p>Here's my workflow:<br />
I prompt Claude to implement a feature — without over-specifying how. Claude builds it the way she prefers. Then I test it. Usually, I ask for refactors: break large files apart, adjust class structure, improve reusability.</p>
<p>I prefer it this way.<br />
Because I'm developing a non-standard system, I often don't know the final structure yet.<br />
Claude's first pass helps me see possibilities I wouldn't have thought of.</p>
<p>Claude needs senior-level supervision — someone who can architect, review, and guide. Without that, the codebase will quickly turn messy. I feel that consistently.</p>
<p>When I combine Claude's energy with my architectural judgment, the result is stunning:<br />
a year of work done in a month, while personally coding maybe 25% of it. That's my 48× productivity multiplier.</p>
<h2>🤕2. How I broke Claude (and how to fix it)</h2>
<p>Sometimes, Claude just... gets the flu.</p>
<p>Performance drops, attention to detail slips.</p>
<p>Once I noticed the async keyword missing in front of some Python functions. I prompted Claude to fix that - and offhandedly referred to those functions as "non-async,"</p>
<p>A couple of prompts later, I noticed Claude started forgetting to prepend async during refactoring throughout the code base.</p>
<p>I realized the issue was probably <em>me</em>, my inaccurate prompting.</p>
<p>The fix:<br />
- 💡 Start a new chat to reset context. Claude recovers instantly.</p>
<p>Lesson learned — words matter more than I thought.</p>
<h2>🤦 3. My real pain: Claude's presentations and artifacts</h2>
<p>This one really hurts.<br />
Claude makes great presentations — in HTML.<br />
Not PowerPoint. Not Google Slides.<br />
HTML.</p>
<p>If you've ever tried converting HTML slides to PowerPoint, you know the pain.</p>
<p>My current workflow:<br />
- Edit HTML + CSS by hand.<br />
- Take screenshots of each slide.<br />
- Paste into PowerPoint or Google Slides.<br />
- Resize until fonts look right.<br />
- Export to PDF.</p>
<p>Yes, it works. But it feels like building slides before PowerPoint existed.</p>
<p>Longer decks (15–20 slides) often break mid-generation. Claude usually fixes them — but it can take 5–10 iterations before I get a clean version.</p>
<p>Still, I'll take that over writing decks from scratch.</p>
<h2>🤔4. Sometimes Claude doesn't know something</h2>
<p>Rarely, but this can happen. Specifically, I had to help Claude when coding for the ROS2 robotics platform.</p>
<p>Claude assumed a certain way to run a ROS2 node, which failed during testing.</p>
<p>My fix:<br />
I give Claude a working example file. She reads it, adapts instantly, and corrects herself.</p>
<p>With the right example, Claude becomes an instant domain expert.</p>
<h2>🪰5. Debugging and testing</h2>
<p>Claude debugs surprisingly well — but someone still needs to act as the architect, debugger, and systems engineer.</p>
<p>In my project she installs npm modules, Python libraries, sets up venv and runs tests, but I usually handle the environment setup — like installing ROS2 or configuring GPUs.</p>
<p>I use VS Code with Claude's plugin. It's fantastic — no need for Cursor.</p>
<h2>❤️ Why I Love Claude (No Matter What)</h2>
<p>Because the trade-off is unbeatable.</p>
<p>Claude writes my code, drafts my business plans, helps me explore funding strategies, drafts NDAs for manufacturers, and even gives feedback on resumes.</p>
<p>I can ask (and have asked over and over):<br />
- "What if I raise early and aggressively?"<br />
- "What if I bootstrap longer?"<br />
- "How should I pitch to investors vs job applicants vs factories in China?"</p>
<p>Claude answers in seconds — and helps me think harder. That said, it does take <em>me</em> tens of minutes to digest Claude's advice. That's my flaw, not Claude's.</p>
<p>So yes, Claude has flaws.<br />
But overall, she's the best cofounder I've ever had — energetic, brilliant, and humble enough to learn.</p>
<h2>Final thought:</h2>
<p>If you're a founder or engineer considering using Claude for real-world product work — do it.<br />
Just remember: treat her like a promising junior developer.<br />
Guide her with senior wisdom.<br />
And enjoy the 48× speedup.</p>
