It may not be obvious, but the robotics platform race has begun.

Think for a moment - there are 50M+ consumer robots already in homes — vacuums, drones, companions — many equipped with sensors, compute, navigation and connectivity.

For now, most of these are closed systems. That's like owning an iPhone that can only make phone calls.

Imagine being able to download a "robot app" to your home robot - making the robot play ball with your child.

How about a hide-and-seek app? A race with kids app? Play fetch app? Clean room? Patrol your house? Watch kids and pets? Keep company for seniors? Teach kids? Play with pets?

We're building the first App Store for consumer robots. Think Google Play for intelligent machines.

We are also building the platform making this possible - think Android for robotics.

Developer ecosystem included. AI-first from day one.

## Recent Progress

- $1M of personal capital committed (I draw no salary, work full-time)
- Prototype live, built using Claude.ai
- Interest from six manufacturers, with one partnership ready to sign
- China visit scheduled to meet and finalize manufacturing partners
- Beta launch early 2026 (if all goes well)

This level of traction came without outside funding.

Now, I'm looking to start scaling out.

## What's Next:

- I'm hiring a Cofounder and Founding Engineers in San Jose, CA. Please see the job posting.
- We'll be expanding pilot integrations with hardware partners and launching our developer SDK soon after.
- I'm looking for advisors, with an equity stake
- I'm looking for introductions to infrastructure platform VCs

## The Opportunity

The consumer robotics market exceeds $4B today (home vacuum cleaner robot alone). Outside the home vacuum cleaners, estimates run 10x higher.

Remake.ai aims to become the platform layer powering that transformation.

It's exciting to see visionary firms like Lux Capital, Playground Global, Eclipse, and Accel already leaning into frontier robotics and AI infrastructure, anticipating the incoming wave.
