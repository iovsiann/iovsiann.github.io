title: My Search for a Startup Cofounder

excerpt: How I searched for a startup cofounder and what I learned about the process in 2025.

I'm building Remake.ai, a company with a simple but ambitious goal: to make home robots run apps.

Y Combinator (my startup accelerator idol) strongly recommends that startups have cofounders, and I believe that having one could significantly improve my chances of getting accepted. At the same time, I should admit: I don't strictly need a cofounder. I'm technical and hands-on enough to build everything myself. Beyond that, I can hire, contract, or outsource the rest—from business operations to sales.

Still, I decided to give the search an honest try. Here's what I've done so far:

**Announced the startup publicly.** I came out of stealth on LinkedIn.

**Signed up for YC's cofounder matching platform.** I've connected with a few people there, but progress has been slow. About half of my "matches" are really using the platform to get hired, rather than to cofound.

**Reached out to former colleagues.** These are people I consider 10x engineers and would gladly work with again. About half replied, but none were available.

**Posted online.** I shared my search on LinkedIn, relevant subreddits, Hacker News and industry forums. Mostly silence. I did post in r/roastmystartup and got a helpful reply—thank you, internet stranger! Posting on Hacker News under the title of "Roast my startup" got me another reply.

**Posted a job opening on LinkedIn.** Another experiment, with similar results.

**Hired recruiters.**

After about a month of this, here's what I've learned:

**The potential cofounder pool is small.** YC's platform shows about 16K total, worldwide.

**The filtered pool is tiny.** For people in the Bay Area, interested in robotics, and available to quit their jobs soon, that number drops to just a few hundred.

**After manually reviewing profiles,** I've identified about a dozen I'd actually like to talk to.

**Response rates aren't great:**

- ~50% of invites are declined.
- ~20% of accepted invites never lead to a meeting.
- Of those I meet, about half are really just looking for a job.

**On the bright side,** there's a surprisingly wide range of aspiring cofounders—ages 16 to 70.

All in all, it hasn't felt like much progress.

But—I think I may have found a different solution. One that I genuinely love. It might seem unusual, surprising, or even a little shocking.

I'll share it in my next post.
