                <p>It may not be obvious, but the robotics platform race has begun.</p>
<p>Think for a moment - there are 50M+ consumer robots already in homes — vacuums, drones, companions — many equipped with sensors, compute, navigation and connectivity.</p>
<p>For now, most of these are closed systems. That's like owning an iPhone that can only make phone calls.</p>
<p>Imagine being able to download a "robot app" to your home robot - making the robot play ball with your child.</p>
<p>How about a hide-and-seek app? A race with kids app? Play fetch app? Clean room? Patrol your house? Watch kids and pets? Keep company for seniors? Teach kids? Play with pets?</p>
<p>We're building the first App Store for consumer robots. Think Google Play for intelligent machines.</p>
<p>We are also building the platform making this possible - think Android for robotics.</p>
<p>Developer ecosystem included. AI-first from day one.</p>
<h2>Recent Progress</h2>
<ul>
<li>$1M of personal capital committed (I draw no salary, work full-time)</li>
<li>Prototype live, built using Claude.ai</li>
<li>Interest from six manufacturers, with one partnership ready to sign</li>
<li>China visit scheduled to meet and finalize manufacturing partners</li>
<li>Beta launch early 2026 (if all goes well)</li>
</ul>
<p>This level of traction came without outside funding.</p>
<p>Now, I'm looking to start scaling out.</p>
<h2>What's Next:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I'm hiring a Cofounder and Founding Engineers in San Jose, CA. Please see the job posting.</li>
<li>We'll be expanding pilot integrations with hardware partners and launching our developer SDK soon after.</li>
<li>I'm looking for advisors, with an equity stake</li>
<li>I'm looking for introductions to infrastructure platform VCs</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Opportunity</h2>
<p>The consumer robotics market exceeds $4B today (home vacuum cleaner robot alone). Outside the home vacuum cleaners, estimates run 10x higher.</p>
<p>Remake.ai aims to become the platform layer powering that transformation.</p>
<p>It's exciting to see visionary firms like Lux Capital, Playground Global, Eclipse, and Accel already leaning into frontier robotics and AI infrastructure, anticipating the incoming wave.</p>
<p>Please sign up for our upcoming platform launch at <a href="https://Remake.ai">https://Remake.ai</a></p>
