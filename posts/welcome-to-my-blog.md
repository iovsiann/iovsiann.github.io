## Welcome

I'm excited to launch this blog as a space to share my thoughts and experiences in technology, particularly around deep learning, AI hardware, and imaging systems.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you can expect posts covering:

- **Deep Learning Hardware**: Insights into neural network accelerator design, optimization techniques, and architectural patterns
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Practical applications, research trends, and lessons learned from deploying AI systems
- **Imaging Technology**: CMOS sensors, image processing pipelines, and computational photography
- **Software Engineering**: Best practices, tools, and techniques I've found valuable over the years

## Background

With over two decades in technology spanning hardware design, ASIC development, deep learning, and imaging systems, I've had the opportunity to work on projects that shipped in over a billion devices. I've architected neural inference hardware, designed imaging sensors, and led teams tackling complex technical challenges.

This blog is a way to give back to the technical community and share knowledge gained through years of hands-on experience.

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow technologists. Feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iliao/) or check out my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UMqM9DQAAAAJ) to learn more about my work.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you find the content here valuable!
