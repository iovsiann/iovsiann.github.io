                <p>Early-stage startups need face-to-face collaboration. Yet, I'd like to hire remotely for cost savings. Can I have BOTH?</p>
<p>My solution: hire internationally and fly periodically to co-work in person. Details in my previous post: https://ovsy.com/posts/why-im-flying-to-work-with-my-remote-engineers-instead-of-finding-a-bay-area-cofounder.html</p>
<p>In this post I describe how to find, screen and hire remote talent quickly. Here's what actually works.</p>
<h2>The LinkedIn Problem</h2>
<p>I Posted a "Full Stack Developer" role → 1,000 applications in 24 hours.</p>
<p>Sounds great until you realize:</p>
<ul>
<li>1,000 resumes to screen (no time as solo founder)</li>
<li>Schedule interviews with promising candidates</li>
<li>Co-working sessions (standard for early-stage)</li>
<li>Negotiate salary, equity, benefits</li>
<li>Repeat for each role</li>
</ul>
<p>Time cost: weeks. I stopped after two attempts.</p>
<h2>The Upwork Solution</h2>
<p>I switched to Upwork (not affiliated, just sharing what works). Here's my actual process:</p>
<h3>1. Hire Freelancers Directly, Not Agencies</h3>
<p>Why no agencies for early-stage?</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-PMF, I don't have a spec. I'm iterating MVP prototypes rapidly—build, test, discard, rebuild. The spec emerges through iteration.</li>
<li>Agencies need specs upfront</li>
<li>Quality drops when agencies swap devs without telling you (happened multiple times)</li>
<li>No agency overhead</li>
<li>I interview the actual developer, not a manager</li>
<li>Contract-to-hire path for growing headcount</li>
</ul>
<p>Exception: If you have a well-defined project scope and aren't growing staff, agencies can work fine.</p>
<h3>2. My Screening Process</h3>
<ul>
<li>Post job with clear description + skill tags (no paid promotion initially)</li>
<li>Shortlist: Top 10%+ badge AND in a location I can visit (safe, accessible)</li>
<li>Filter out hidden agencies:</li>
<li>Check profiles for "team" mentions</li>
<li>Skip freelancers with $500K+ earned or 100+ jobs (likely agencies)</li>
<li>Read feedback between the lines (I've been pressured to change &lt;5 star reviews to 5 stars)</li>
<li>Paid trial task (up to 8 hours)</li>
<li>Zoom interview with video ON (watch for interview proxy services)</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Key Questions I Ask</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explain your project</li>
<li>Look for genuine signals the dev feels your project is not difficult - confirm the reasons are right</li>
<li>Are you OK with me visiting to work face-to-face periodically?</li>
<li>Do you use Claude Code or similar AI tools? (Required for my projects)</li>
<li>Communication test: Can we understand each other easily?</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Trial Task</h3>
<p>"I'm hiring you for a paid trial (up to 8 hours). You must do this yourself. If you don't pass, that's fine—5 stars and we may work together on another project. If you pass, expect regular Zoom video calls."</p>
<p>This discourages interview proxies.</p>
<h2>Cost Optimization</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use basic Upwork membership (5% fee). Premium (10% fee) shows top 1% badge, but I don't see meaningful difference vs. top 10%.</li>
<li>SF Bay Area founding engineer: ~$183K total comp</li>
<li>International senior engineer: $40-80K (via Upwork)</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: 2-4x headcount for same budget</p>
