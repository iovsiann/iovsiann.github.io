excerpt: How AI-assisted coding is transforming startup development and changing fundamental calculations about capital and cofounders.

Vibe coding - we use it at Remake.ai and can't get enough of it. It saves us hundreds of thousands of dollars annually AND we accomplish in one day what an entire remote team did in one week.

We use it to prototype complicated solutions that combine full-stack, cloud deployment and robotics control. With AI doing almost all coding, I end up acting as (1) the software architect and (b) the project tester (and occasional debugger).

The increase in performance is so high, it changes fundamental startup calculations - including not needing to raise capital and cofounders being able to keep their daytime job, vibe-coding in their free time and still making a huge contribution.

In my case, "vibe coding" is a misnomer. We are not building off a feeling/vibe. We know exactly what needs to be coded. I'd call it "delegation coding".

All said, I feel bad about junior developers as I observe the entry-level software development jobs disappear en masse.

If you, as a junior developer, want to stay in this industry despite the odds, consider continuing learning intensively and in a "breadth-first" manner. This should help you understand the "big picture" in software development projects. Aim to become a "junior software architect" and let AI do the coding. That said, don't neglect learning technologies in depth as well.
