            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Three months ago, I started searching for a cofounder for my robotics startup in California. The ideal candidate profile was clear: 10x engineer, top-tier school credentials (helpful for fundraising pre-traction), located in the SF Bay Area.</p>
<p>After three months of searching—including creative outreach that generated half a dozen face-to-face interviews—I found exactly zero cofounders.</p>
<h2>The Expiration Date</h2>
<p>Here's the thing about cofounder searches: they have an expiration date. At some point, the business needs to move to its next phase, with or without the perfect cofounder. I hit that point two weeks ago during a manufacturing trip to China.</p>
<p>While there, I did some math. The cost of flying to China and staying for two weeks was two orders of magnitude less than paying a single month's SF Bay Area salary for an engineer ($2K/month vs $160/year + $2K/month benefits + $25K capital rais bonus + equity).</p>
<p>That's when I realized I was optimizing for the wrong constraint.</p>
<h2>Splitting the "Ideal" Cofounder</h2>
<p>I was looking for someone who was both a 10x engineer and had top-tier credentials. But what if I split that persona into two separate hires?</p>
<p>New approach:</p>
<p><strong>Hire 1: Remote high-performer via Upwork</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$20-80/hour (2x to 4x cheaper than SF startup salaries)</li>
<li>Autonomous, enthusiastic, hard worker</li>
<li>Location: anywhere</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hire 2: Part-time advisor with tier-1 credentials</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Equity only</li>
<li>Primary role: help with fundraising credibility</li>
<li>Location: anywhere</li>
</ul>
<p>My wife is okay with me traveling, so I dropped the location filter entirely.</p>
<h2>The Problem With Remote at This Stage</h2>
<p>Here's where it gets tricky. I'm still at the very early MVP stage. The ideation and trial-and-error loop is brutally fast—especially because I'm using Claude Code to implement ideas. (I use Claude for everything in MVP prototyping, and it's been fantastic.)</p>
<p>The problem: that fast iteration loop doesn't work well with remote. If I send specs in the evening, get implementation in the morning, test during the day, and repeat—we're already adding 12+ hour delays to each cycle. When you're running multiple cycles per day in-person, going remote feels like moving through molasses.</p>
<h2>The Solution: Hybrid "Out-Person" + Remote</h2>
<p>Here's what I'm planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fly to the freelancer's city</li>
<li>Stay in a hotel for 1-2 weeks</li>
<li>Bring hardware and MVP prototype with me</li>
<li>Work face-to-face to get them to 100% productivity</li>
<li>Return home</li>
<li>Work remotely until the next in-person sprint is needed</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost structure makes sense. A week or two of travel + accommodation + focused work is still 10x dramatically cheaper than SF salaries. And I can work from anywhere with my laptop.</p>
<h2>What do you think about it?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Has anyone else tried this hybrid approach? How did it work out?</li>
<li>What are the failure modes I'm not seeing?</li>
<li>Is this sustainable long-term?</li>
</ul>
<p>I know this is unconventional. Most advice says "MVP phase = everyone in the same room." But most advice also assumes you have the capital to pay SF salaries or the network to find cofounders quickly.</p>
<p>I don't have either, but I do have a laptop, Claude Code, and the ability to get on a plane.</p>
<p>Maybe that's enough.</p>
